Disney's Baymax is as an inflatable robot with a carbon fiber skeleton built by Hiro Hamada's older 
brother Tadashi to serve as a personal healthcare companion.
He is immediately activated at the sound of a person experiencing pain.
Due to being a personal "healthcare companion".
He is calm and caring,
and one of his functions is that located on his chest is a small chip port.
Any chip can be inserted into it and give He large amounts of knowledge.
His healthcare chip instructs him with "10,000 different medical procedures".
Hiro later gives him a battle chip that instructs him on numerous forms of martial arts.
It is shown that when his healthcare chip is removed, He becomes deadly and slightly uncontrollable.
To coat his easily deflatable body, He wears bright red armor with purple accents.
The suit has wings that allow him to fly and his fists can detach like rockets.
He's armor also has small magnets attached to his back that allow Hiro to stick to him in flight.
